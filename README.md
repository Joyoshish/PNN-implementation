# Preference Neural Network (PNN) 
![ScreenShot](/Images/PNN.png)
PNN is a native ranker neural network implemented for label ranking using Spearman ranking error function and Positive/Smooth Staircase activation function (SS) and (PSS) to enhance the prediction probability to produce almost discrete value without data freedom between layers, thus it use one middle layer for learning.

SGPNN is extended PNN to ranke subgroup of labels using one learning model. the subgroups are combined from multiple domains to find a hidden relations between these groups.

These two networks use a new type of multi-values activation functions, Positive smooth staircase (PSS) and Smooth Staircase (SS) employed for ranking
